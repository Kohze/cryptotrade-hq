              CryptoTrade HQ is a place where several cryptocurrency traders meet, discuss their trades and ideas, and hang around. We come from different backgrounds,
              have different experiences, trade different markets, and use different styles of trading. While we love to discuss ideas, we’re almost never in agreement,
              which we think is a good thing since it allows for more and better ideas to arise, improving our trades.
              Before you begin anything, these are the most important rules of trading (cryptocurrency or anything else). It’s not enough to just follow these rules, you
               must know them because they are the difference between you having an enjoyable time, to potentially destroying yourself emotionally or even physically in a moment of despair.

                              Never trade what you can’t afford to lose. This means not enslaving yourself by taking any loan by a bank, organization or
                              friend/family to use for trading. This means not using money that you need to pay your daily routine and basic survival. This
                              means not taking from your future savings. This means, only trading with that surplus which you could do without. You have to assume
                              the money you use for trading is a good as gone. You have to be emotionally unattached to it. And after you must protect it at all costs.

                              In cryptocurrency, we are still in the equivalent of a wild-west. That means strangers will try every trick to guess your password,
                              to scam you, to infect your computer, to steal your wealth from you. Distribute your trust sparingly. Use two-factor-authentication
                              for all your on-line activities (e-mail, social media, device access, exchange log-in and withdrawal). Write down your most
                              important passwords offline. Get a good antivirus. And even after all this, beware what hyperlinks you click, and who you talk to.
                              Lastly, always double-check the information you are writing down concerning passwords and addresses, as one simple forgotten or
                              mistyped character is enough for you to lose access to your wealth.

                              The whole traditional trading ecosystem, and the new one emerging, are made to separate you from your money as fast as possible.
                              They have huge conflicts of interest with you. They encourage you to overtrade and bleed you out from trading fees. To borrow money
                              for your trades by using margin. They encourage you to join pyramid schemes, they trust that you won’t do proper background checks.
                              Have high standards for where you decide to put your money. Do not leave your money on exchanges unless you absolutely have to.
                              Spread your money through different exchanges to minimize your risk if one goes under. Control your own keys/seed of your cryptocurrency
                              as much as possible. Prepare for the worst, it might come when you least expect it.

          <h4>  What is trading? </h4>
          <p style="-webkit-column-count: 2;
            -moz-column-count: 2;
            column-count: 2;">
            One of the main concepts to understand is that, fundamentally, people can't really agree about the price of something. If we all agreed that, for example, one
            bitcoin is always worth one dollar, then the chart would appear as a constant horizontal line. In reality, the price of bitcoin does many things over the course
             of days, weeks, months, and years, but none of them is being constant. This is because people disagree about the price; there is an imbalance in supply and demand.
             In other words, the amount of people that want to buy/sell, and the amount they want to buy/sell, is different than the reverse, the amount of people that want to
             sell/buy, and their respective amount.

            (Bitcoin all time price chart, from Bitstamp. Chart from bitcoincharts.com)
            Furthermore, these imbalances happen across different scales of perceptions in the buyers/sellers time, price, volume, and other indicators. This simply means that all
            buyers and sellers may agree on the price, but only for a certain time, or that only some buyers/sellers agree on the price, while others don't.
            As such, all chart patterns are but a reflection of these different types of imbalances across the different scales, which is why it is possible (though not easy) to
            use the charts to understand the forces behind the current price, and where it might go in the near future. And the price can only move in three directions: up, down, or sideways.

            <h4> Directions </h4>
            <p style="-webkit-column-count: 2;
              -moz-column-count: 2;
              column-count: 2;">
            When the price is going up, this means that at that moment there are more buy orders than sell orders. When an overall market is trending up, we refer to it as a bull/bullish
             market, given that a bull strikes with its horns from the bottom-up. A bull market or bull trend is recognized since the price is making higher highs and higher lows over certain timeframes.
            If the price is going down, this means that at that moment there are more sell orders than buy orders. This is referred to as a bear/bearish market, given that a bear strikes
            with its paws from the top-down. A bear market or bear trend is recognized since the price is making lower highs and lower lows.
            And if the price is going sideways, like I've mentioned before, it means the buy orders and sell orders are more or less in equal stand, and buyers/sellers agree on the price.
            But keep in mind that it takes a seller to sell to a buyer, and a buyer to buy from a seller. So even if the price is going up because there are more buy orders than sell orders,
             it doesn't mean there are more buyers than sellers, just that the two disagree on the way the price will move, or have different plans that made them execute that trade. If absolutely
             everyone thought the price for something would always go up to infinity and it aligned with their interests, nobody would sell it, and nothing would be exchanged.
            </p>

            <h4> Profiting </h4>
            <p style="-webkit-column-count: 2;

              column-count: 2;">
            So how exactly do traders make money from trading? One way which is the most common one is to buy something at a low price, and sell it at a higher price. This is referred to as "going long" or a "long position".
            However, this is not the only way to trade. Traders can also profit when the price is going down. This is referred to as "going short" or "shorting". To achieve this, the trader must borrow the thing being traded from someone, sell it at a high price, wait for the price to drop, buy the same amount at a lower price, return the asset/commodity/currency to the lender, and keep the difference as profit. For this type of trading, special accounts are usually required where the trader borrows money from a broker or an online exchange.

                                  Technically speaking, investing isn’t a type of trade, though if it were it would be similar to a long trade. However, most people confuse the two.
                                   Investing is taking advantage over the growing cryptocurrency economy being built, whereas trading is profiting from the specific volatility that
                                   is occurring in the meantime. In the cryptocurrency space, investing is sometimes referred to as “holding” or “hodl”, as an encouragement for those
                                   less interested in trading to just focus in the long term value increase.

          In trading there are different types of analysis to analyze if a trade is worth pursuing or not. The four main types are: Fundamental analysis, technical analysis, cycle analysis and risk analysis.
          The first is fundamental trading, or "trading on fundamentals". This usually is reserved for long-term trades or investments in the technology, reputation, developing team, usage, network valuation, etc. <br> <br>
          The second is called technical analysis (usually heavily reliant on chart analysis), and is most suited for shorter term trading, precisely to take advantage of daily/weekly/monthly volatility swings. In technical analysis, the objective is to read different market indicators (such as volume, trends, opening/closing price, averages, support and resistance levels, etc) concerning and/or based on the change in price, and to gauge the market sentiment to infer where the price might go next.
          The third is called cyclical analysis. A lesser known variant of technical analysis that assumes markets (which are based on human emotions) have a rhythm, an ebb and flow to the emotions, which is translated in the price. Cycles are analyzed based on moving averages, RSI, Stochastics, breakout and pullback ranges, and by looking at the fractal nature of price movement within shorter chart timescales and how it relates to bigger chart timescales. <br><br>
          The last one is risk analysis. It deals mainly with the trader’s exposure to risk in a trade, or how he/she enters, spreads, and exits a position. It deals with price entries, profit targets, stop losses, managing a position by adapting the average cost of the position through a timeframe.

          Basic trading info tells you not to set profit targets. I (Hayen) have a different idea, since that advice is good for novice people that are likely to go all-in in one position hoping for 200% returns in 1 week.
          My idea is that when you have different entries at different prices in one coin, you can manage both your profits, expectations and anxieties much better. In this idea, it's almost as if you treat each entry as a completely different trade, almost like a different coin.
          As an example, let's take IOTA and let's say you want to see 2x profits in your trades but unlike new people to the game you are patient and know how to manage your trades. In this example, IOTA is trading at $4 when you first look at it. It looks overbought but you want to start a small position just in case it continues to go up. Your first position must be small because you're expecting it to go down, but you should have a position since it is an insurance in case the price goes against what you expect. <br> <br>
          First position @ $4, you put 5-10% of the available fiat or btc you have available to trade. Your expectation with this entry is to sell it when it reaches $8 (so 2x profits).
          Time passes and the price goes down, like you expected. Let's say it drops by half, to $2. Even though you have a small loss, this is when you start your second entry. You add 10-15% of your available fiat or btc, and your expectation is to sell those and only those iotas that you bought at $2 at $4 so you get 2x profits. However, your position is still relatively small since you expect it to go down, but you're building your amount so that if it rebounds to your profit target for those two previous entries you can claim the profit. Let's continue. <br> <br>
          Price falls even more. It's now down to $1. It's approaching where you think it'll bottom out (based on Fundamentals, TA, cycle analysis) though there is still more room possibly. Here you start another position, 15-20% of your available Fiat or btc, with the expectation to sell those iotas acquired at $1 when they reach $2 (2x profits again).
          At this moment, you have positions at $4, $2, and $1 respectively. Your total used Fiat or btc is a combined 40-50%. You're taking some loss on your first positions (4x loss in first position, but that's where you put the least amount of money, and 2x loss in the other one), but since you've spread your positions in this way, most of your money is closest to the actual price, and not stuck in the first position at $4, which would have rightfully freaked you out by now.
          Right now you're ready for iota to go up, but it gets really oversold and drops further to $0.5. This is when you really get heavy (assuming all Fundamentals, TA and cyclical analysis is sound). <br> <br> A good example of when not to get heavy when it's crashing down is when there is a fundamental problem with the blockchain technology (imagine a fatal flaw was found in the Tangle, allowing people to steal millions). If this rare event would happen, since most of your money is closest to the price, you would take a smaller loss than if you had put all your money first at $4 (which would mean you would have a staggering 8x loss). So now you put the rest of your money: 45-50%. <br><br>
          So now you've allocated all the money you had saved for this one coin (you still keep more money for other coins and follow similar trading positioning) and you wait. Since you're flexible with your positions you should also be flexible with your stop loss. The price might drop below $0.5, but you're calm since all the other signals are showing you it'll go up (ex: team is still working on coin, updates are shared, roadmap is being followed, TA shows you're still in a channel or haven't considerably broken support, the cycle shows you you're about to turn to an upside, etc). So now you wait, and once the price starts going up, that's when you gradually exit each of your position, one by one. <br><br>
          If the price goes up slowly, then you take your profits slowly exactly as you had planned. At each time one of your position reaches 2x profit, you sell only that position. If the price goes up, you get ready to sell the next position once it reaches the next 2x profit. If it tumbles back down, you wait for it to reach your next entry area and rebuy with the profits of the first sell.
          However, and what sometimes happens, is that people get FOMO, and as you bought the bottom, you got it perfectly. So the price will increase much faster than you can sell the first position where you wanted. This is when you actually get more profits than you intended, but it's not something you plan for. You could make more profits if you had waited for your $0.5 iota to reach $4, but the point of selling on the way there is that most of the time the price tumbles up and down, breaking out then pulling back, rather than going vertically in one full move. <br> <br>
          And of course it goes without saying that this is only one example. You decide the position size, the profit targets, the position entry (for example, buying at every 25% decrease instead of 50% like in my example, etc) and of course you will have a different view of how the market will move due to your own analysis of Fundamentals, TA, cycles, etc.
          This example was for a long position on a downtrend. If you start a long position and price goes immediately up into a solid uptrend, then you need to add your next positions heavy at the start so you keep the average cost lower, and enjoy higher profits after it has risen. And the opposite of both these cases has to be considered for short positions.
